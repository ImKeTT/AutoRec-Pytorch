# AutoRec_pytorch
## Run AutoRec(2015) by Pytorch
## These codes are based on the paper 'AutoRec: Autoencoders Meet Collaborative Filtering'
## And my traning datasets are ml-100k and ml-1m from MovieLens 
## Unfortunately neither of them achieved the results the paper AutoRec expected
## Since it's my first time pulling a repository at github as well as post my codes
## It'll be nice of you to have a look at my codes and kindly give me some advice
